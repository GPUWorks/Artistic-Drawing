# Artistic-Drawing
The aim of this project was to generate artistic hand-like pencil drawn lines/curves. We
will be given a set of points, we have to join them in order as if they were joined manually.
While there is no precise metric yet discovered to differentiate between hand-drawn and
computer-generated line drawings, humans can typically distinguish with ease the difference by
a shear glance.
The goal of this project is to produce lines that resembles a human-drawn line, and may
be uses it to replace traditional computer drawn lines.vdsdvd
