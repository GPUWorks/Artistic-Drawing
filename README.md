# Artistic-Drawing

The aim of this project is to generate artistic human-like drawn lines/curves. While there is no precise metric yet discovered to differentiate between hand-drawn and computer-generated line drawings, humans can typically distinguish with ease the difference by a shear glance. The goal of this project is to produce lines that resembles a human-drawn line, and may
be uses it to replace traditional computer drawn line.
